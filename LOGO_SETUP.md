# Logo Setup Instructions

## To use your logo image file:

1. **Save your logo image** as `logo.png` in the `src/assets/` directory
   - Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP
   - Recommended size: 32px height or larger (will be scaled down)
   - Recommended format: PNG for best quality

2. **File location**: `src/assets/logo.png`

3. **Build the project**: Run `npm run build` to process the image

4. **The logo will automatically appear** in your application

## Current setup:
- HTML references: `./assets/logo.png`
- JavaScript imports: `./assets/logo.png`
- Webpack will process and copy the image to the public directory

## If you have a different filename:
- Rename your image to `logo.png`, OR
- Update the references in `src/index.html` and `src/index.js` to match your filename

## Supported image formats:
- PNG (recommended)
- JPG/JPEG
- GIF
- WebP

The image will be automatically optimized and included in your build!
