# Graph Creator Pro

A powerful, interactive web application for creating, visualizing, and analyzing graphs with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Graph Creation** - Click to add vertices, drag to move them
- **Smart Edge Creation** - Click two vertices to connect them
- **Search Algorithms** - BFS and DFS with animated visualizations
- **Edit Mode** - Hold vertices to edit labels and sizes
- **Save & Load** - Auto-save and manual save/load functionality
- **Screenshots** - Capture and share your graphs
- **Modern UI** - Dark/light theme with responsive design

## 🌟 What Makes Graph Creator Pro Stand Out

Graph Creator Pro hits a sweet spot that many other graph tools miss by successfully combining:

### **Modern, Intuitive UI**
Our tool looks and feels like a modern web app, making users feel they're using a professional-grade product. Unlike many educational tools that feel outdated, Graph Creator Pro provides an engaging, contemporary experience.

### **Integrated Creation and Visualization**
You don't have to switch between a "creator" and a "visualizer." The canvas is live, and the controls are contextual. This seamless workflow is rare in graph tools and makes the experience much more fluid.

### **Comprehensive Session Management**
The Canvas Management panel, with its clear timestamps, vertex/edge counts, and easy deletion, is a standout feature. Combined with robust Save/Load/Share functionality, we treat user creations as valuable data, which many simpler tools neglect.

### **Accessibility**
Being a public website with no download required is key. It lowers the barrier to entry for students, hobbyists, and professionals who just want to quickly sketch out an idea.

**In conclusion**, while tools that perform similar functions exist, Graph Creator Pro unifies the best aspects of them into a single, cohesive, and modern package. We've taken the educational power of an algorithm visualizer, the creative freedom of a graph editor, and the user experience of a modern SaaS application and blended them together.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3002`

## 🎯 How to Use

### Basic Operations
- **Add Vertex**: Click anywhere on the canvas
- **Move Vertex**: Drag vertices to reposition them
- **Create Edge**: Click two different vertices to connect them
- **Edit Vertex**: Hold a vertex for 2.5 seconds to enter edit mode
- **Search**: Use BFS/DFS buttons to visualize graph traversal

### Advanced Features
- **Auto-save**: Graphs are automatically saved as you work
- **Screenshots**: Capture your graphs in JPG or PNG format
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between dark and light themes
- **Panel Dragging**: Reorder control panels by dragging them
