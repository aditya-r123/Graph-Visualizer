# Graph Creator Pro

A powerful, interactive web application for creating, visualizing, and analyzing graphs with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

## 🌟 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Interactive Graph Creation**: Click to add vertices, drag to move them, and create edges between vertices
- **Smart Interaction System**: 
  - **Drag Threshold**: 5-pixel movement threshold to distinguish dragging from clicking
  - **Edit Mode**: Hold vertex for 2.5 seconds to enter edit mode (red glow appears at 1 second)
  - **Edge Creation**: Click two vertices consecutively (dragging prevents edge creation)
- **Real-time Visualization**: Smooth animations and visual feedback for all interactions
- **Multiple Edge Types**: Support for straight and curved edges, directed and undirected graphs
- **Edge Weights**: Add numerical weights to edges for weighted graph analysis
- **Vertex Labels**: Custom labels or auto-generated labels for vertices

### Advanced Editing
- **Edit Mode**: Hold vertex for 2.5 seconds to enter edit mode with comprehensive controls
- **Visual Hold Feedback**: Red glow appears after 1 second of holding, gradually expanding until edit mode activates
- **Smart State Management**: Dragging prevents both edge creation and edit mode activation
- **Apply to All**: Apply changes to all vertices simultaneously (size, label, etc.)
- **Pending Deletion**: Mark vertices for deletion with visual preview before confirming
- **Delete Mode**: Dedicated deletion mode with red X buttons on vertices
- **Visual Feedback**: Fade effects and color changes for pending deletions

### Search & Analysis
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Animated BFS traversal with visual path highlighting
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Animated DFS traversal with step-by-step visualization
- **Distance Calculation**: Calculate shortest path distances between any two vertices
- **Target Selection**: Interactive target vertex selection with visual indicators
- **Collapsible Search Panel**: Expandable search algorithms section

### Save & Load System
- **Auto-Save**: Automatic saving when adding vertices/edges (toggleable)
- **Manual Save/Load**: Save graphs with custom names and timestamps
- **Recent Graphs**: Quick access to recently saved graphs with click-to-load
- **Graph Management**: Delete individual graphs or all saved graphs
- **File Import/Export**: Load graphs from JSON files and export current graphs

### Screenshot & Export
- **High-Quality Screenshots**: Capture graphs in JPG or PNG format
- **Full Graph Data**: Screenshots include all vertex and edge information
- **Custom Format Selection**: Choose between smaller JPG files or higher quality PNG

### User Interface
- **Modern Design**: Clean, responsive interface with Bootstrap styling
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between themes with animated sun/moon icons
- **Eye Tracking**: Interactive sun/moon icons that follow your mouse
- **Collapsible Sections**: Expandable search algorithms panel
- **Smart Scroll Indicator**: "More options" indicator that disappears after 150px of scrolling
- **Status Bar**: Real-time status updates, local time, and contact information
- **Contact Modal**: Built-in contact form for feedback and support

### Accessibility & UX
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all operations
- **Visual Feedback**: Shake animations, color changes, and hover effects
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and tablet devices
- **Intuitive Controls**: Clear visual cues and helpful tooltips
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

## 🚀 Getting Started

## 🎯 How to Use

### Basic Operations
- **Add Vertex**: Left-click anywhere on the canvas
- **Move Vertex**: Drag vertices to reposition them (5-pixel movement threshold)
- **Create Edge**: Click two vertices consecutively to connect them
- **Edit Vertex**: Hold vertex for 2.5 seconds to enter edit mode (red glow appears at 1 second)
- **Delete Vertex**: Use edit mode or dedicated delete mode

### Interaction Timing
- **Quick Click** (< 1 second): Normal edge creation behavior
- **Short Hold** (1-1.25 seconds): Red glow appears, edge creation still works
- **Medium Hold** (1.25-2.5 seconds): Red glow continues, edge creation prevented
- **Long Hold** (2.5+ seconds): Edit mode activated
- **Dragging**: Prevents both edge creation and edit mode activation

### Edit Mode Features
- **Hold to Enter**: Hold vertex for 2.5 seconds to enter edit mode
- **Visual Feedback**: Red glow appears after 1 second, expanding until edit mode activates
- **Label Editing**: Change vertex labels with immediate visual feedback
- **Size Adjustment**: Modify vertex size with live preview
- **Apply to All**: Check the "Apply to All Vertices" option to modify all vertices
- **Pending Deletion**: Mark vertices for deletion with visual preview
- **Save/Cancel**: Confirm changes or revert to original state

### Search Algorithms
- **Select Target**: Click the target selection area to choose a vertex
- **Run BFS/DFS**: Click the respective buttons to start animated traversal
- **Stop Search**: Interrupt ongoing searches at any time


### Save & Load
- **Auto-Save**: Toggle automatic saving in the Save & Load section
- **Manual Save**: Click "Save Graph" to save with custom name
- **Load Graph**: Click "Load Graph" or click on recent graphs
- **Screenshot**: Capture current graph state in your preferred format
